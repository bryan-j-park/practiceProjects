this is  a project I created in order to practice using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The main focus of this project was to start using basic functions in JavaScript in order to have it change elements on the webpage. 

I used CSS to make the layout and change the cursor to a pokeball in order to anime the catches a little bit more. 

Functions like querySelector were used in order to select the individual buttons to animate the page. 

the pokemon caught counter in the top right corner was created by using JavaScript in order to calculate the amount of pokemon that.

Please enjoy my little pokemon game, gotta catch'em all!
